					<h2>Problems to be solved</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>quick setup a working environment (bugfixing etc.)</li>
						<li>up-to-date documentation of the dev environment</li>
						<li>not messing up my own PC</li>
						<li>independence of mimacom servers (slow VPN)</li>
						<li>quick testing with restoring original situation</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

					<h2>What has changed since last presentation?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>80/20: 80% solution, but easier</li>
						<li>using Docker and docker-compose instead of Vagrant, Ansible etc...</li>
						<li>Ansible can be still helpful as "scripting solution"</li>
						<li>not only for development environment, but also for testing etc.</li>

						<h2>Three steps</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Define the services that make up your app in <code>docker-compose.yml</code> so they can be run together in an isolated environment.</li>
							<li>Search for an appropriate base image (e.g. at https://hub.docker.com) and “refine” it with a <code>Dockerfile</code>.</li>
							<li>Lastly, run <code>docker-compose up</code> and Compose will start and run your entire app.</li>

						<h2>Experiences after half a year of use</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>It's easier to overcome the reluctance to look into an issue</li>
							<li>I am quicker up and running with a project to analyse a bug</li>
							<li>I don't fear messing up my setup or the database</li>
							<li>The environment is well documented in form of a runnable setup</li>
							<li>The "documentation" is up to date</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Suggestion</h2>
						<img style="float: left" src="images/pres3/nerd.png"  width="359">
						<p>New projects which are added to the support must either have a dockerized setup or we get budget to set it up.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Variants used</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Third systems running in Docker and application under development running from within IntelliJ.</li>
							<li>With some apps I had the whole system running under Docker (including app server); <br/>
								-> the exploded war artifact on a shared drive and remote debugging the Tomcat from IntelliJ.</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>Variant not used</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>The whole development system in Docker or a VM including IntelliJ, Java etc.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Reason for not using last variant</h2>
						<p>
							I think the effort to set up the 3 variant is too big compared to the gained value. Because having IntelliJ locally installed and having multiple Java versions available is not that much of a hassle. Plus it brings maximum speed (compared to having IntelliJ running within a VM) by using minimal ressources (I used a 8GB notebook and lately a 16GB notebook and it could usually handle the load).

						<h2>Experiences</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>There is a learning curve</li>
							<li>What you learn will help you in projects -> containers are now used everywhere</li>
							<li>Most difficult part: synchronized startup (waiting for other containers)</li>
							<li>It's fun - after some initial frustrations</li>
							<li>After done once or twice it becomes easier...</li>

						<h2>Tipps & Tricks</h2>
						During the setup of some supported applications I stumbled over a few difficulties. The solutions to those problems are documented in Rune:
						<a href="https://rune.mimacom.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=128583776">https://rune.mimacom.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=128583776</a>

						<h2>Used base images</h2>
						When setting up your containers, it's best to search for an existing image which already does what you want. Use it as your base image and just add the needed customization.
						The images I used and how I customized them are also documented in Rune:
						<a href="https://rune.mimacom.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=AAT&title=Successfully+used+Docker+containers">https://rune.mimacom.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=AAT&title=Successfully+used+Docker+containers</a>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Some more tipps to round up</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Reuse containers for minimal effort to setup a new application environment (after I did Oracle, MS SQL, Tomcat, SoapUI, Mailserver containers, I hardly had to make a totally new container any more)</li>
							<li>Use docker-compose to easily start the whole environment</li>
							<li>Document the setup and the needed commands to use it nicely (you are probably not the only one using it) in a README.md file</li>
							<li>Stop containers which are not used to free resources</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Some more tipps to round up cont.</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>clean up you images from time to time</li>
							<li>always have a shared directory in order to easily exchange files between host and container (e.g. to try out database scripts)</li>
							<li>if you don't know already, learn a bit of bash (to do stuff within the container) and use docker exec -it to work within the container</li>
							<li>be careful with access rights (stuff created within the container is usually done as root and you might have a hard time to delete/change it from outside the container</li>
